<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>This is one of the best movies of all time. I love the interesting take about aliens and how language affects the mind.</p>
<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>Like Arrival, this movie hows how complex our univerese can be.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>Very differnt from the first two spots but this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine.</p>
